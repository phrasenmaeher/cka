# Centered Kernel Alignment 
Implementation of paper ["Do Wide and Deep Networks Learn the Same Things? Uncovering How Neural Network Representations Vary with Width and Depth"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15327) by 
Thao Nguyen and Maithra Raghu and Simon Kornblith. Please find my post explaining the implementation on [Medium/TDS](https://towardsdatascience.com/do-different-neural-networks-learn-the-same-things-ac215f2103c3).

The current implementation focuses on creating similar figures as in the paper:

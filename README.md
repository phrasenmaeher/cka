#### Since I've coded this implementation, official code has been released. This also features a more efficient calculation and more accurate results. Therefore, I recommend the [official implementation](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/master/do_wide_and_deep_networks_learn_the_same_things/efficient_CKA.py)

# Centered Kernel Alignment 
Implementation of paper ["Do Wide and Deep Networks Learn the Same Things? Uncovering How Neural Network Representations Vary with Width and Depth"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15327) by 
Thao Nguyen and Maithra Raghu and Simon Kornblith. Please find my post explaining the implementation on [Medium/TDS](https://towardsdatascience.com/do-different-neural-networks-learn-the-same-things-ac215f2103c3).

The current implementation focuses on creating figures similar to those in the paper:
